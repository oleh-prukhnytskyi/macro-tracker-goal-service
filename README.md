**Nutrition Calculation Engine.**

A stateless microservice dedicated to calculating daily caloric needs and macronutrient splits based on user biometrics.

## :zap: Service Specifics

* **Stateless Architecture**: Designed as a pure computational unit with no database dependency, ensuring millisecond response times and effortless horizontal scaling.
* **Scientific Accuracy**: Implements the **Mifflin-St Jeor** equation (standard for clinical settings) with activity level multipliers to determine Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE).
* **Goal Adaptation**: Automatically adjusts calculations based on the user's specific objective (Weight Loss, Maintenance, or Muscle Gain).
* **Observability**: Built-in **JSON Structured Logging** (Logstash) and OpenTelemetry instrumentation for seamless integration with the ELK Stack.

## :electric_plug: API & Communication

* **Internal Communication**:
    * Primarily consumed by the **User Service** (via Feign Client) during profile creation or updates.
    * Exposes a `POST /api/goals` endpoint accepting user details (Age, Weight, Height, Gender, Activity Level).
* **Public Documentation**:
    * Fully documented via **OpenAPI 3.0** (SpringDoc).
